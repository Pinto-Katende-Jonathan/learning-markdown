# Images

Here's the syntax for including images in markdown.

```
![Image Alt Text](ImageURL 'Optional Image Title')
```

![Meow](https://i.imgur.com/6NthqvQ.jpg "Cats ❤️ Markdown")

___

You can also use referrances, like so: `![Meow][cat]`  
The alt text and referrence to the image source.
Later (maybe at the end) you add the image URL.

`[cat]: https://i.imgur.com/6NthqvQ.jpg`

Instead of `[cat]` you can use any string or number.
